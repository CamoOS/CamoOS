## ðŸŸ¦ FAQ

<details>
<summary>There is a broken Edge application in the Start menu. Is this normal?</summary>
This is perfectly normal, UninstallAllEdgeChromium doesn't do a good job a lot of times.
</details>
<details>
<summary>My ISO contains OneDrive. Why?</summary>
OneDrive is not removed because depending on the user's threat model, it might be useful. You can uninstall it if you wish, though some ISOs won't contain it.
</details>
<details>
<summary>Building failed!</summary>
This is usually because you used a 2016- image, or an IoT image. You can fix this by renaming the index to <code>Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC</code>, but it will be untested, and as such, no support. It is recommended to use the latest stable build provided in the releases page.
</details>
<details>
<summary>My checksums don't match!</summary>
If you haven't synced the checksum file along with the ISO, the checksums won't match since every ISO created will be unique. This is a technical limitation of the tools that the build script uses. Otherwise, the ISO may have been tampered with or corrupted.
